This web application is designed to display information about movies using an external API, The Movie Database (TMDb). It consists of a frontend built with Next.js and a backend developed using Node.js with Express. The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly movie information application with features like browsing popular movies, searching for movies by title, and viewing detailed movie information.
